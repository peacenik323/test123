-why must be separate. i dunno, correlate each as they relate to a coupla current systems.  why not 'collective individualism'? are they the only two options, can people opt out if what they don't vote for wins, or is our only recourse to attempt to persuade/provide examples and proof. individualism in its pure form may only be achievable in it's pure form in theory (or we can certainly argue it is somewhat rare to be able to exist anywhere currently and not be subject to laws et al), akin to the argument against communism

by having an opinion or hope or dream that applies to others are we attempting to exert control or demonstrate righteousness?  does a lack of absolute and unwavering/changing convictions demonstrate weakness?  Does it prevent delusions, or prevent us from accessing a part of our capability based on faith, confidence?

What did i learn from prolonged interpersonal interactions among a group of adults usingvaried coping and self-medicating techniques to understand, and justify our existence and actions. I learned that's a load of baloney and I cannot fully understand anyone's motivations and reasons for their motivations. but can seek to help us humanize, accept and respect and learn from each other by listening, and relating experiences.  In order to get respect one must understand the person they seek respect from, i ran into some things here same as MKE, where the question becomes do i change my mannerisms/behaviour in a fashion that does not coincide with my beliefs?  To survive short-term maybe, and i did, but after thinking through the possible scenarios and my feeling of 'not being able/caring if die due to a feeling that i already was (in a strangely connected sense, day 3 or so of being up and after another intense uncontrollable physical (oxygen and energy) emotional experience same as during laundry weekend, triggered by an oldies song in the park)   of toughness or willingness to resort to violence) and risks (alot) result (  

Uncertainty and questioning of values, realization that questioning of values and extreme self-doubt caused fear, confusion.  An attempt to be thankful (Thanks Mom!) or find some damn positive aspect of this foundational shaking of my beliefs to also be enlightening.  Is that a natural or learned survival mechanism.  Consider other methods of arousing and nurturing this as a healthy curiosity in thought origin.

In a situation where knowledge of external motivations are not available, acknowledged as speculative, incomplete and subject to interpretation 

To gain acceptance or in a desperate seeking of approval or acceptance, an incessant, annoying, inarticulate and unsolicited stream of 'unconsciousness' spewed forth from me to anyone in range for about 8hrs?) and just further contributed fuel to the fear fire.  Experience an inability to decide on any damn thing or make any damn sense at all.  Motor skills affected, which led to another unexpected realization - that sometimes we are not efficient and clumsy and lack grace and that is OK, and there is beauty in our styles, and our messes.

Sensory inputs (e.g. our interpretation of social interactions, unrelated but present sounds, auditory hallucinations, spiritual/emotional growth) combined with stress, a desire to prove or illustrate my beliefs around money/love/values, physical proximity, narcissism, all combined with my m
ultitudinous other conditions (lack of partner/physical gratification due to reliance on/preference to porn [normal i think somewhat given the additive chemical[s]) effect and lead to significantly debilitating cognitive and social function.

But history shows that it is neither strong armies nor an abundance of weapons that guarantees peace. It is the goodwill of all sides, based on self-interest. And the wisdom of politicians – a rare ingredient, indeed.

Method to control - need to define control - 'if you can't measure it, you can't manage it' saying.  measurement is important to learning (in bottom up/OWA system)? progress? to progress must have start? baseline? if measured (how/methods) by LCD are we progressing (is it inevitable given expansion?)

Setting up hosted (shared) networking

Run as admin:
C:\Windows\system32>netsh wlan start hostednetwork
The hosted network started.

TODO:
1. Setup a VPN on local machine (maybe)
2. use xfinitywifi ability to connect to the net or other method to find an ip/connect to a vpn (add network)


2. Do what travis recommended (XFINITY Free WiFi Hack For Free Internet #2 - not sure if changing or spoofing mac address, find out if can spoof, if so what is benefit), copy config to phone










xfin wifi connection properties

For maximum security, you may want to create a port forwarding rule that forwards a random “external port” – such as 23243 – to “internal port” 1723 on your computer. This will allow you to connect to the VPN server using port 23243, and will protect you from malicious programs that scan and attempt to automatically connect to VPN servers running on the default port.
